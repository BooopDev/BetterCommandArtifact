### Command artifact go brrrrrrrr........

A nice QOL mod that changes the way that the command artifact behaves. Instead of giving you a selection of every item in the game, you now get to choose the exact amount of items that get shown. Set the item count to your liking, make it higher, make it lower, you have control. (default is 5 items)

## How it works

This is a super simple mod, so listen up. 

1. Pick a number between 1 and another number. Let's say 5.
2. Punch that number into the config file.
3. Load up the game.
4. Turn on the Command Artifact
5. Pick up an item.
6. Get 5 random items instead.
7. Cry in a corner

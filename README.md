### Limiting Endless Possibilities Since 2021

A QOL mod that changes the way that the command artifact behaves to create a more balanced experience while playing. 

## How it works

The command artifact has been altered to reduce the amount of items shown. By default this mod will only show you 5 random items but this can be changed within the config file.

## Feedback
Please feel free to provide feedback or bug reports if you come across any issues while using this mod.
